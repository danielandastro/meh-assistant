# meh-assistant
The Meh Assistant is a quirky command line personal assistant.
Project Update 22 - 5 - 17: Have decided to continue project in c# as Visual Studio if prefered over Eclipse Neon. Have moved all Java files to the Java Branch and will replace all of the current Master files with c#. Will also be providing windows executables with the c# files. Version 0.2 will be the last Java Release of the MEH Assistant.
With the realease of version 0.4 of the MEH project, the Java releases are terminated, however, anyone with time to kill can do the required conversions to java and release them or use them (under the license)

12 August 2017 - This repository is now fairly messy and outdated, however I have completely rewritten and further optimized the C# code with key features (such as replacing the if-else statements, which were becoming way too messy and inefficient, especially as more commands are added) and split it into multiple classes. See the new rewrite [here](github.com/danielandastro/meh-rewrite) enjoy.
