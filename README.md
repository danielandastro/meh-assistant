# meh-assistant
The Meh Assistant is a quirky command line personal assistant.
Project Update 22 - 5 - 17: Have decided to continue project in c# as Visual Studio if prefered over Eclipse Neon. Have moved all Java files to the Java Branch and will replace all of the current Master files with c#. Will also be providing windows executables with the c# files. Version 0.2 will be the last Java Release of the MEH Assistant.
