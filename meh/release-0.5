Welcome to the first major update to the MEH system, version 0.5 "The Dictonary Update". The name is due to an addition of a very important
new feature, the define command. This command makes use of WordNet, which you can find out about here: https://wordnet.princeton.edu/. The 
define command requires 4 WordNet files: wn.exe, wnb.exe, tcl84.dll and tk84.dll. These files need to be in the working directory of the MEH
system executable, and are included in the repository. The next update 0.6 will likely bring more mathematical operations to add functionality
to the system.
